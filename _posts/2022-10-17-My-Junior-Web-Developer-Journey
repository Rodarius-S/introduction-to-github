Below are the ways I found helpful to study. No, list isn't inclusive or every studying tool
nor is it meant to be used as a must do. These are things I use to keep me accountable. I like to have a written
record of my work and I also like for other people to be able to monitor my progress too.

To sharpen my coding skills I have a weekly target to  _PRACTICE SIX DAYS A WEEK_  Even though it seems like a heavy target there are many ways to achieve this goal. </p>
<h3> **_Different Ways To Practice_** </h3>
<ul> 
  <li> Go to Coding Bootcamp 5x a week. </li>
  <li> Login to Github and work on a practice project. </li>
  <li> Meet with my study partner outside of class. </li>
  <li> Practice coding on the Codecademy app on my phone </li>
</ul>  

<p> No it's not easy, but is anything the first time around? Also, the pay off is worth it every time. I know that learning this new skill will open empoloyment doors for me. My main motivation for this is to better financially provide for my familyy. </p>
