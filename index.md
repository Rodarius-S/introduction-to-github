# Nothing Comes Easy, It All Takes Practice 
## Am I The Only One Who Hates Failing 
 Of course I know that isn't true, but it doesn't feel less real. Something about using Github for the first time was really nerve wrecking. For some reason. the site seemed overwhelming. The feeling of fear was so strong it almost m ade me back out of my commitment. The only way to shake this fear is by [Practicing](https://www.github.com/skills)! I am commited to using the skills I've learned on [Codecademy](https://www.codeacademy.com). *Welcome to my coding and blogging journey.* 
### Stay Commited, See Results!
